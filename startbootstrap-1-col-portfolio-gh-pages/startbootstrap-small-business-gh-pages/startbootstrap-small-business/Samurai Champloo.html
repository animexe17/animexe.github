                <h1>Synopsis</h1>
                <p>Samurai Champloo tells the story of three strangers in the Tokugawa era (also known as the Edo Period) who come together on a journey across Japan.A young woman named Fuu is working as a waitress in a tea shop when she is harassed by a band of samurai. She is saved by Mugen, a mysterious rogue, and Jin, a young ronin. Mugen attacks Jin after he proves to be a worthy opponent and they begin fighting one another and inadvertently cause the death of Shibui Tomonoshina, the magistrate's son. For this crime they are to be executed. With help from Fuu, they escape, though Fuu insists that they travel with her to find "the samurai who smells of sunflowers." They agree to join her, with Fuu setting the condition that they are not to duel one another until the journey is done.</p>

                <h1>Mugen</h1>
                <p>Rude, lewd, vulgar, conceited, temperamental, and psychotic, Mugen is something of an antihero. He is fond of fighting and has a tendency to pick fights for petty reasons.Mugen has messy brown-black hair in an afro-like style  and a faint beard. His clothing is anachronistic as well, reminiscent of baggy hip-hop fashions of today. His attire consists of a light grey shirt with a stitch pattern running down the middle and ending at the halfway point of the shirt. He wears this under a red short-sleeve happi that functions as a jacket. He wears dark gray hakama cut off at shorts-length, resembling loose-fitting Bermuda shorts and Japanese Geta  on his feet. these geta are fitted with several metal strips on the soles, allowing him to use his sandals as blocking devices. He has two blue ring tattoos, two on each wrist and two just above the ankles. Lastly, he carries his sword on his back with a sash that goes from his left shoulder to his right hip, favoring his right hand. It has a zig-zag pattern of green and yellowish-brown.</p>

                <h1>Fuu</h1>
                <p>Fuu is the tritagonist and leading lady of Samurai Champloo. Following a series of circumstances, she tricks Mugen and Jin into accompanying her into her journey in finding the "Sunflower Samurai". She likes meddling into the business of other people, which is also the reason why she was able to get Jin and Mugen to come with her. Her full name is Fuu Kasami. Fuu has brown hair in a the style of a ponytail with two parts of her hair that hang down. One being in on her right side and one being infront of her face on the left side. a deep pink kimono with a pattern of flowers and carries a matching tantō. Attached to the tanto are three netsuke: a skull, a pair of dice, and a dog. Her kimono hides her surprisingly curvacious figure.</p>

                <h1>Jin</h1>
                <p>Unlike Fuu and Mugen, Jin is calm and collected under the most dire of circumstances, leading both Fuu and Mugen to confide in him. However, his stoic demeanor can irritate his companions since he responds to their thoughts with sighs or grunts. By his own admission, Jin has spent most of his time focusing on improving his skills and almost no time at all on cultivating friends. This lack of companionship means that he values Fuu's and Mugen's friendship, and seems genuinely saddened when the three part ways. Although the two annoy him on occasion, he is often willing to take on an extremely deadly opponent alone in order to allow them to escape.Jin also seems annoyed by those who use their martial arts skills to oppress people, especially those who proclaim that they are doing it in service of their lord. Jin will often remark that there is no honor in serving a cruel tyrant. Throughout the series he is hunted by his former classmates at the dojo as well as several other ronin who wish to kill him and make a name for themselves.</p>
